# Adaptive-High-Beam-Control
Python Script written for automatic detection of vehicles during night time
and auto switching of high beam to low beam or vice versa.
When a vehicle coming from opposite direction is detected using headlights,
camera detects and sends a signal to arduino using GPIO pins to make the beam
low.
Also based on steering wheel direction movement headlights turns in direction
of travel of a vehicle.
